# Real-Time Crypto Market Intelligence Pipeline

Portfolio-grade streaming data engineering project for ingesting public crypto market data, processing it with Kafka and Spark Structured Streaming, storing Bronze/Silver/Gold Delta Lake datasets, and serving real-time market intelligence signals.

This project is not a trading bot, does not execute trades, and does not provide financial advice. It uses only Binance public market WebSocket streams with no API key and no account-specific data.

## Project Goal

Crypto markets generate continuous, high-frequency trade and price events across many assets. Raw WebSocket payloads are semi-structured and not immediately suitable for analytics, monitoring, or dashboarding. This project builds a production-style streaming pipeline that validates, routes, stores, deduplicates, aggregates, and serves those events as market intelligence outputs.

## Core Components

- Local Kafka broker using Docker Compose
- Kafka UI for topic inspection
- Project folder scaffold
- Topic configuration and creation script
- Storage folders for Bronze, Silver, Gold, and checkpoints
- JSON Schema contracts for raw market events, invalid events, and alerts
- Kafka topic design documentation
- Async Binance WebSocket producer for trade, kline, and ticker streams
- Producer-side validation and invalid-event publishing to `market.events.invalid`
- Bronze Structured Streaming jobs that preserve Kafka metadata in Delta Lake
- Silver Structured Streaming jobs that normalize and deduplicate market events
- Gold Structured Streaming jobs that compute OHLC, volatility, volume spikes, price movement alerts, and watchlist summaries
- Alert publishers that convert Gold signals into Kafka alert events
- Streamlit dashboard for Gold outputs, alert history, and pipeline health

## Local Services

| Service | Purpose | Local URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kafka | Local broker for raw, DLQ, and alert topics | `localhost:9092` |
| Kafka UI | Inspect topics, partitions, messages, and consumer groups | `http://localhost:8080` |

## Kafka Topics

| Topic | Purpose | Partitions | Key | Schema |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `market.trades.raw` | Raw trade events from Binance WebSocket | 6 | `symbol` | `schemas/trade_event_v1.json` |
| `market.klines.raw` | Raw 1-minute candlestick events | 3 | `symbol` | `schemas/kline_event_v1.json` |
| `market.tickers.raw` | Raw 24-hour ticker events | 3 | `symbol` | `schemas/ticker_event_v1.json` |
| `market.events.invalid` | Dead-letter queue for invalid or malformed events | 3 | `source_topic` or `error_type` | `schemas/invalid_event_v1.json` |
| `market.signals.alerts` | Gold-level market intelligence alerts | 3 | `symbol` | `schemas/alert_event_v1.json` |

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Docker Desktop or compatible Docker runtime
- Docker Compose v2
- Python 3.11+
- Bash

Run the local stack:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
bash kafka/create_topics.sh
docker compose ps
```

Open Kafka UI:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

List topics:

```bash
docker compose exec -T kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --list
```

The same workflow is available through `make`:

```bash
make up
make topics
make topics-list
```

Kafka broker data is stored in a named Docker volume, so ordinary `docker compose down` and `docker compose up -d` cycles keep topics, committed offsets, and retained messages. Removing volumes with `docker compose down -v` intentionally resets Kafka state.

Install and run the producer:

```bash
make setup-venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m producers.binance_ws_producer
```

Or run through Make with the virtualenv interpreter:

```bash
make producer PYTHON=.venv/bin/python
```

Run a Bronze stream:

```bash
make bronze-all PYTHON=.venv/bin/python
```

Bronze Delta outputs are written under `./storage/bronze`. Checkpoints are written under `./storage/checkpoints/bronze`.
Local Spark jobs use the virtualenv PySpark runtime by default so an unrelated machine-level `SPARK_HOME` does not leak into the project.
The grouped Bronze runner starts trades, klines, tickers, and invalid-events queries inside one Spark application. Its Spark UI defaults to `http://localhost:4040`.

Run a Silver stream after the matching Bronze stream has created data:

```bash
make silver-all PYTHON=.venv/bin/python
```

Silver Delta outputs are written under `./storage/silver`. Checkpoints are written under `./storage/checkpoints/silver`.
The grouped Silver runner starts trades, klines, and tickers queries inside one Spark application. Its Spark UI defaults to `http://localhost:4050`.

Run Gold analytics after `silver_market_trades` has data:

```bash
make gold-all PYTHON=.venv/bin/python
```

Gold Delta outputs are written under `./storage/gold`. Checkpoints are written under `./storage/checkpoints/gold`.
The grouped Gold runner starts OHLC, trade summary, volatility, volume spike, price movement alert, and watchlist summary queries inside one Spark application. Its Spark UI defaults to `http://localhost:4060`.

Publish Gold alerts back to Kafka:

```bash
make alerts-volume PYTHON=.venv/bin/python
make alerts-price PYTHON=.venv/bin/python
```

Alert publisher checkpoints are written under `./storage/checkpoints/alerts`. Alert events are published to `market.signals.alerts` and can be inspected in Kafka UI or from the terminal:

```bash
make alerts-consume
```

Run the dashboard:

```bash
make dashboard PYTHON=.venv/bin/python
```

The dashboard reads Gold Delta tables under `./storage/gold` and Kafka alert events from `market.signals.alerts`.

Inspect Delta tables in JupyterLab:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name crypto-market-intelligence --display-name "Crypto Market Intelligence (.venv)"
.venv/bin/jupyter lab
```

Open `notebooks/inspect_delta_tables.ipynb` and select the `Crypto Market Intelligence (.venv)` kernel.
